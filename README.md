# Movie Industry Analysis
Authors: Cayke Felipe dos Anjos, Dolgor Purbueva

### Overview  
This project analyzes past movies data to offer strategic business recommendations for a new film studio. We aim to predict the most profitable strategies for film production and release by examining production budgets, gross revenues, net profits, genres, popularity, key staff and release timelines. As result this project provides three business recommendations: what genre should a future movie be, what budget to allocate and when to release it.  
### Business Problem  
The company is expanding its portfolio by investing in a new film studio. Launching a film studio in today's competitive entertainment industry requires a solid understanding of what drives movie success and attracts audiences. The movie industry is known for its substantial risks and high capital demands. Recent developments in AI have made video content creation faster and more efficient, increasing competition but also opening up new opportunities to enter the market.  
Our project aims to analyze various datasets, including past movies' financial results, genre correlations, and movie ratings and popularity. By using data analysis techniques, we seek to gain valuable insights and identify patterns that can help shape the company's film production strategy. The goal is to provide three concrete business recommendations that maximize profitability and lower business risks, ensuring a strong entry into the market.  
Questions we tried to answer with analysis:
* How should the movie be budgeted?
* What genres are most profitable?
* When should a movie be released?

### Data Understanding  
We used datasets from Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, Bom Office Mojo, IMDB and The Numbers. Each dataset is of different size and contains different data catecories which might be seen as a limitation. For every question we answer we choose the most relevant dataset or merge some of them together for a fuller picture.  
For budget related analysis we used IMDB and The Numbers. TheMovieDD dataset was used to explore movie ratings and popularity.
